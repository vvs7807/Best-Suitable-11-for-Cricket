Project Sportan is a project focused on creating an optimal cricket team using statistical performance metrics. The goal is to form a team that can consistently score high and effectively defend competitive totals across different match situations.

Objective
The key objective of this project is to build a cricket team that:

Can score at least 180 runs on average.
Can defend a total of 150 runs with efficient bowling.
Player Selection Criteria
To ensure the team is well-balanced, the following parameters are used for selecting players based on their roles:

1. Openers:
Batting Average: Greater than 30 (Average runs per inning)
Strike Rate: Greater than 140 (Runs per 100 balls)
Boundary Percentage: More than 50% (Percentage of runs scored through boundaries)
Batting Position: Less than 4 (Player's batting order)
2. Anchors / Middle Order:
Batting Average: Greater than 40
Strike Rate: Greater than 125
Average Balls Faced: Greater than 20 (Balls faced per innings)
Batting Position: Greater than 2
3. Finishers / Lower Order Anchors:
Batting Average: Greater than 25
Strike Rate: Greater than 130
Innings Bowled: More than 1
Bowling Economy: Less than 7 (Runs allowed per over)
4. All-rounders / Lower Order:
Batting Average: Greater than 15
Strike Rate: Greater than 140
Bowling Strike Rate: Less than 20 (Balls required to take a wicket)
Bowling Economy: Less than 7
5. Specialist Fast Bowlers:
Bowling Economy: Less than 7
Bowling Strike Rate: Less than 16
Dot Ball Percentage: Greater than 40% (Percentage of dot balls bowled)


Methodology

Data Collection: Data is gathered from player performance statistics across multiple matches.

Parameter Scoping: Criteria for player selection are defined based on various roles such as openers, middle order, and bowlers.

Team Formation: Players that meet the required parameters are selected to create an ideal playing XI.



Tools & Technologies

Python: Used for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.

Pandas & NumPy: For manipulating and filtering player statistics.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Utilized for visualizing performance trends and player statistics.

Power BI: Deployed for creating interactive visualizations of player performance.

Jupyter Notebook: Used for conducting the analysis in an interactive environment.

Git: For version control and project management.


Results:

The result of this project will be a cricket team made up of players who meet the specified performance criteria. The selected players excel in both batting and bowling, ensuring a balanced and competitive team suitable for various match conditions.
