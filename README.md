This Project is designed to create an optimal cricket team based on a set of performance parameters. The goal is to form a team capable of consistently scoring high and defending competitive totals in various match scenarios. This project focuses on selecting players based on statistical metrics like batting average, strike rate, boundary percentage, bowling economy, and more.

Objective
The primary objective of Project Sportan is to create a balanced cricket team that:

Can score at least 180 runs on average.
Can defend a total of 150 runs with consistent bowling performance.
Parameters for Player Selection
The project defines specific parameters for selecting players in various roles, ensuring that each player contributes effectively to the team's overall performance. These include:

1. Openers:
Batting Average: > 30 (Runs per inning)
Strike Rate: > 140 (Runs per 100 balls)
Boundary %: > 50% (Percentage of runs scored in boundaries)
Batting Position: < 4 (Batting order)
2. Anchors / Middle Order:
Batting Average: > 40
Strike Rate: > 125
Avg. Balls Faced: > 20 (Balls faced per innings)
Batting Position: > 2
3. Finishers / Lower Order Anchors:
Batting Average: > 25
Strike Rate: > 130
Innings Bowled: > 1
Bowling Economy: < 7 (Runs allowed per over)
4. All-rounders / Lower Order:
Batting Average: > 15
Strike Rate: > 140
Bowling Strike Rate: < 20 (Balls required to take a wicket)
Bowling Economy: < 7
5. Specialist Fast Bowlers:
Bowling Economy: < 7
Bowling Strike Rate: < 16
Dot Ball %: > 40% (Percentage of dot balls bowled)
Methodology
The methodology focuses on:

Data Collection: Gathering player statistics from various matches.
Parameter Scoping: Defining criteria for player selection in different roles (openers, middle order, bowlers).
Team Formation: Selecting players who meet the defined criteria and creating an ideal playing XI.
Tools & Technologies Used
Python: For data processing and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: To manipulate player statistics and apply selection filters.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing player performance and parameter trends.
Power BI: Used for creating rich, interactive visualizations of player performance and team statistics.
Jupyter Notebook: To perform the analysis in an interactive environment.
Git: Version control for tracking the evolution of the analysis.
Results
The final output of this project will be an optimized cricket team composed of players who meet the performance criteria and can excel in both batting and bowling, ensuring a well-rounded team that performs in different match situations.
